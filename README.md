# GridPro - The Smartest Connect-4 AI ♟️🧠

> An AI-powered Connect-4 game built in Go — born from a real-life defeat and rebuilt for total domination. The mission? Never lose again. 🚀

## Project Status 🚦

 **Live & Learning** — Features a competitive Connect-4 AI with Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning. Fully playable via a modern web UI.

## AI Implementation 🤖

The AI uses a combination of advanced techniques to provide a challenging opponent:

### Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning ♟️
- **Iterative Deepening + Time Budget** ⏱️: Searches progressively deeper up to `MaxDepth` (currently 12) within ~`TimeLimitMs` (1400ms) per AI move
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** ✂️: Optimizes the search by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision
- **Heuristic Evaluation** 🧮: Evaluates board positions based on:
  - Center control (prioritizes center columns)
  - Potential winning moves (threat detection)
  - Defensive play (blocks opponent's winning moves)

### Evaluation Function 🧠
- **Center Control**: Bonus points for pieces in central columns
- **Potential Wins**: Detects and prioritizes creating multiple winning opportunities
- **Defensive Play**: Recognizes and blocks opponent's threats
- **Win/Loss Detection**: Immediate evaluation of terminal states

### Performance Optimizations ⚡
- **Opening Book** 📘: Hard-coded optimal early moves to accelerate strong starts
- **Preferred Move Ordering** 🎯: Center-out ordering improves pruning
- **Suicidal Move Filter** 🚫: Avoids moves that allow the opponent an immediate win
- **Transposition Table** 🗂️: Caches board evaluations to avoid recomputation (improved keying — no depth collisions)
- **Early Termination** 🛑: Respects a strict time limit per move

## How to Run ▶️

### 1. Backend (Go API) 🧩
- Make sure you have Go installed (1.18+ recommended).
- Start the backend server:
  ```sh
  go run main.go
  ```
- The backend will listen on `http://localhost:8080`.

#### API Endpoints 🔌
- `POST   /api/new`   — Start a new game. Returns a game ID and initial state.
- `POST   /api/move`  — Make a move. Body: `{ "gameId": string, "col": int }`. Returns updated state.
- `GET    /api/state` — Get current state. Query: `?gameId=...`.
- `GET    /api/info`  — Get backend info (version, opening preferences).

### 2. Frontend (Web UI) 🖥️
- Serve the `docs/` folder with any static file server. For example:
  ```sh
  npx serve docs -l 3000
  # or
  python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory docs
  ```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- The frontend will talk to the backend API at `localhost:8080`.

## Deployment 🚢

- Frontend: Deployed via GitHub Pages.
- Backend: Hosted on Render.
- Make sure to update the API base URL in `script.js` if deploying somewhere else.

## Customizing the AI 🎚️

You can adjust the AI's difficulty by modifying these constants in `backend/ai.go`:
- `MaxDepth`: Maximum search depth (default 12). Higher = stronger but slower.
- `TimeLimitMs`: Per-move search budget in milliseconds (default 1400ms).
- Evaluation function weights in `evaluateBoard()` (threat and center weights tuned for stronger play)

## Future Improvements 🔮

- [ ] Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- [ ] Add move history and undo functionality
- [ ] Optimize evaluation function for better performance
- [ ] Persistent transposition table across moves within a game with better keying

## Tech Stack 🧰
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend**: Go net/http
- **AI**: Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning

## Why GridPro? ❓

Connect-4 is a **solved game**. With perfect play, the first player can always win. GridPro implements advanced AI techniques to provide a challenging opponent that adapts to your skill level. If you beat it… we tune it. 😉
